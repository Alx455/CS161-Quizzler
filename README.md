# CS161-Quizler

This project is for curious, innovative and quick thinking individuals who possess creative minds and love to challenge themselves among their peers. Quizzler is a web-based game that provides a fun, competitive, and collaborative team building experience to test IQ and brain power--unlike any other competing online gaming services. Our product focuses on building social connections while putting capable minds to use, all for free. 
What truly sets Quizzler apart is its creative game mechanics inspired by the thrill of popular and classic racing games. During each round, players receive random in-game items that can be used either to boost their own performance or disrupt their opponents—introducing an exciting layer of unpredictability and strategy. Whether you're stealing points, blocking answers, or activating power-ups, every round becomes a unique battle of wits and tactics. And best of all, it’s completely free—making it the perfect platform for team-building events, classrooms, or simply having fun with friends while leveling up your brainpower.
